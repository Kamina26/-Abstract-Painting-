# Real-time doodle drawing
use OpenCV to draw some doodle images which is a popular and abstract art.
In the beginning, we should import the required libraries:
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    import random
For “random” I can say to work with randomness, including generating random numbers, shuffling sequences, and making random choices from a list we can use this library. Because of the abstract shapes.I am using this library.
To have a canvas of 800X800 for color drawing of a doodle image with a white color.
